Install rpsec gem, than you can start specs with the default command.

```
➜  checkout_promo git:(master) ✗ rspec
..........

I've written all code in the checkout.rb file, because it's small and quite simple. And I've written all specs in the specs/checkout_spec.rb file with the same reason. I didn't use rails or other frameworks because I didn't want to make it complex.
